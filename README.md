# Welcome!
This is the repo for a lifted version of the summer project I worked on in the summer of 2019 at Learning A-Z. This project was a great experience and enhanced my abilities in many ways such as writing clean code, improving system design patterns, and learning new languages/frameworks.

# Stack:
- MySQL
- PHP
- AngularJS
